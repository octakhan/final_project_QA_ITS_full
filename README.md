This is the final individual project which I have prepared during the QA/MST at IT School.
We have been given a website along with the test plan and the client requirements analysis, leaving the rest of the QA/ST process to us in its entirety.
The documentation present covers every step of the STLC in detail and is organized accordingly. The files are named in a self explanatory manner to make things more facile when perusing.
The xlsx files are the 'backbone' of the documentation and they represent the test suites/test cases for each possible scenario, while most of the rest of the docs cover the found issues.
